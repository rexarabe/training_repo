6.4.5  Adding Units to systemd
Adding units to systemd is primarily a matter of creating, then activating and possibly enabling, unit files.
You should normally put your own unit files in the system configuration directory /etc/systemd/system so that you won't confuse then with anything that came with your distribution and so that the distribution won't overwrite them when you upgrade.

Because it's easy to create target units that don't do anything and don't interfere with anything, you should try it. 
Here's how to create two targets, one with a dependency on the other:
1.Create a unit file named test1.target:
[Unit]
Description=test 1

2.Create a test2.target file with a dependency on test1.target:
[Unit]
Description=test 2
Wants=test1.target

3.Actuvate the test2.target unit (remmeber that the dependency in test2.target cause systemd to activate test1.target when you do this):

#systmctl start test2.target

4.Verify that both units are active:
#systemctl status test1.target test2.target


Note:
If your unit file has an [Install] section, "enable" the unit before activating it:
#systemctl enable unit

Try this with the preceding example.
Remove the dependecy from test2.target and add an [Install] section to test1.target containing WantedBy=test2.target.


Removing Units 
To remove a unit, follow these steps:
1. Deactivate the unit if necessary:
#systemctl stop unit

2. If the unit has an [Install] section, disable the unit to remove any dependent symbolic links:
#systemctl disable unit

3. Remove the unit file, if you like.
