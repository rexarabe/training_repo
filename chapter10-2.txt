10/2 Network Servers

Most network servers are like other server daemons on your system such as cron, except that they interact with network ports.
In fact, recall syslogf discussed in Chapter 7; it accepts UDP packets on port 514 when started with the -r option.
These are some other common network servers that you might find running on your system:
httpd, apache, apache2  Web servers
sshd Secure shell daemon (see Section 10.3)
postfix, qmail, sendmail Mail servers
cupsd Print server
nfsd, mountd Network filesystem (file-sharing) daemons
smdb, nmbd  Windows file-sharing daemons (see Chapter 12)
rpcbind  Remote procedure call (RPC) portmap service daemon

One feature common to most newrok servers is that they usually operate as multiple processes.
At least one process listens on a network port, and when a new incmoing connnection is received, the listening process uses fork() to create a new child process, which is then responsible for the new connection.
The child, often called a worker process, terminates when the connection is closed.
Meanwhile, the original listening process continues to listen on the network port.
This process allows a server to easily handle many connections without much trouble.
There are some exceptions to this model, however.
Calling fork() adds a significant amount of system overhead.
In comparison, high-performance TCP servers such as the Apache web server can create a number of worker processes upon startup so that they are already there to handle connections as needed.
Servers that accept UDP packets simply receive data and react to it; they don't have connections to listen for.
