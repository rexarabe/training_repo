Chapter 10: NETWORK APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES

This chapter explores basic network applications - the clients and servers running in user space that reside at the appliaction layer.
Because this layer is at the top of the stack, close to end users, you may find this material more accesible than the material in Chapter 9.
Indeed, you interact with netwrok client applications such as web browsers and email readers every day.

To do their work, network clients connect to corresponding network servers.
Unix network servers come in many forms.
A server program can listen to a port on its own or through a secondary server.
In addtion, server have no common configuration database and a wide variety of features. Most servers have a configuration file to control their behavior (though with no common format), and most use the operating system's syslog service for message logging.
We'll look at some common servers as well as some tools that will help you understand and debug server operation.

Network clients use the operating system's transport layer protocols and interfaces, so understanding the basics of the TCP and UDP transport layers is important.
Let's start looking at network applications by experiementing with a network client that uses TCP.
