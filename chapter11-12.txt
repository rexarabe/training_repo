11.12 Including Other Files in Scripts
If you need to include another file in your shell script, use the dot (.) operator.
For example, this runs the commands in the file config.sh:

. config.sh

This "include" file syntax does not start a subshell, and it can be useful for a group of scripts that need to use a single configuration file.
