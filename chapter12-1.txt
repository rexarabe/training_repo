12.1 Quick copy
Let's say you want to copy a file (or files) from your machine to another one on your network, and you don't care about copying it back or need to do anything fancy.
Y^ou just want to do it quickly.
There's a convenient way to do this with Python.
Just go to the directory containing the file(s) and run
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This starts a basic web server that makes the directory available to any browser on the network.
It usually runs on port 8000, so if the machine you run this on is at 10.1.2.4, go to http://10.1.2.4:8000 on on the destination and you'll be able to grab what you need.
