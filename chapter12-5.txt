12.5 NFS Clients
The standard system for file sharing among Unix systems is NFS; there are many different versions of NFS for different scenarios.
You can serve NFS over TCP and UDP, with a large number of authentication and encyption techniques.
Because there are so many options, NFS can be a big topic, so we'll just stick to the basics of NFS clients.
To mount a remote directory on a server with NFS, use the same basic syntax as for mountaing a CIFS directory:

#mount -t nfs server:directory mountpoint

Technically, you don't need the -t nfs option because mount should figure this out for you, but you may want to investigate the options in the nfs(5) manual page.
(You'll find several different options for security using the sec option. Many administrators on small, closed networks use host-based access control. However, more sophisticated methods, such as Kerberos based authentication, require additional configuration on other parts of you system.)

WHen you find that you're making greater use of filesystems over a network, set up the automounter so that your system will mount the file-systems only when you actually try to use them in order to prevent problems with dependencies on boot.
The traditional automounting tool is called automount, with a new version called amd, but much of this is now being supplanted by the automount unit type in systemd.
