12.6 Further Network File Service Options and Limitations
Setting up an NFS server to share files to other Linux machines is more complicated than using a simple NFS client.
You need to run the server daemons (mountd and nfsd) and set up the /etc/exports files to reflect the directories that you're sharing.
However, we won't cover NFS servers primarily because shared storage over a network is often made much more convenient by simply purchasing an NAS device to handle it for you.
Many of these devices are Linux based, so they'll naturally have NFS server support.
Vendors add value to their NAS devices by offering their own administration tools to take the pain out of tedious tasks such as setting up RAID configurations and cloud backups.
Speaking of cloud backups, another network file service option is cloud storage.
This can be handy when you need the extra storage.
This can be handy when you need the extra storage that comes with automatic backups and you don't mind an exrta his on performance.
It's especially useful when you don't need the service for a long time or don't need to acces it very much.
You can usually mount Internet storage much as you would NFS.
Although NFS and other file-sharing systems work well for casual use, don't expect great performance.
Read-only access to larger files should work well, such as when you're streaming audio or video, because you're reading data in large, predictable chunks that don't require much back-and-forth communication between the file server and its client.
As long as the network is fast enough and the client has enough memory, a server can supply data as needed.
Local storage is much faster for tasks involving many small files, such as compiling software packages, and starting desktop enviroments.
The pictures becomes more complicated when you have a larger network with many users accessing many different machines, because there are tradeoffs between convenience, performance, and ease of administration.
