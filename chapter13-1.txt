13.1 Guidelines for Creating Startup files
When designing startup files, keep the user in mind.
If you're the only user on a machine, you don't have much to worry about because error only affect you and they're easy enough to fix.
However, if you're creating startup files meant to be the defaults for all new users on a machine or network, or if you think that someone might copy your files for use on a different machine, your task becomes considerably more difficult.
If you make an error in a startup file for 10 users, you might end up fixing this error 10 times.
Keep two essential goals in mind when creating startup files for other users:

Simplicity Keep the number of startup files small, and keep the fiels as small and simple as possible so that they are easy to modify but hard to break.
Each item in a startup file is just one more thing that can break.

Readability   Use extensive comments in files so that they users get a good picture of what each part of a file does.
