15.4 Lex and Yacc
You might encounter Lex and Yacc when compiling programs that read configuration files or commands.
These tools are building blocks for programming languages.

Lex is tokenizer that transforms text into numbered tags with labels.
The GNU/Linux Version is named flex. You may need a -ll or -lfl linker flag in conjunction with Lex.

Yacc is a parser that attempts to read tokens according to a grammar.
The GNU parser is bison; to get Yacc compatibility, run bison -y.
You may need the -ly linker flag.
