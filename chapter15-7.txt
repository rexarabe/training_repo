If you're interested in how to design and implement a compiler, two good books are Compiler:
For Scripting language development, it's usually best to look for online resources, as the implementations vary widely.
Now that you know the basics of the programming tools on the system, you're ready to see what they can do.
The next chapter is all about how you can build packages on Linux from source code.
