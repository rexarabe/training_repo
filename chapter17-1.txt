17.1 Web Servers and Applications
Linux is a popular operating system for web servers, and the reigning monarch of Linux application servers in the Apache HTTP Server (usually referred to as just "Apache").
Another web server that you'll often hear about is Tomcat (also an Apache project), which provides support for Java-based applications.
By themselves, web servers don't do much - they can serve files, but that's about it.
The end goal of most web servers such as Apache is to provide an underlying platform to server web applications.
For example, Wikipedia is built on the MediaWiki package, which you can use to set up your own wiki.
Content management systems like Wordpress and Drupal let you build on programming languages that run especially well on Linux.
For example, MediaWiki, Wordpress, and Drupal are all written in PHP.
The building block that make up web applications are highly modular, so it's easy to add your own extensions and create applications with frame-workds such as Django, Flask, and Rails which offer facilities for common web infrastructure and features, such as templates, mutiple users, and database support.

A well-functioning web server depends on a solid operating system foundation.
In particular, the material in Chapter 8 thouth 10 is particularly important.
Your network configuration must be flawless, but perhaps more importantly, you must understand resource management.
Adequately-sized, efficient memroy and disk are critical, especially if you plan to use a database in your application.
