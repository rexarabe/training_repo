More specifically, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to systems that allow you to provision and control basic computing resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking on a remote server.
The OpenStack project is one such API and platform that includs IaaS.
Moving up past the raw infrastructure, you can also provision platform resrouces such as the operating system, database servers, and web servers.
Systems that offer resrouces on this level are said to be platform as a service(PaaS).

Nearly all of the elements that you've seen in this book, starting with the kernel, are reflected throughout these system.
