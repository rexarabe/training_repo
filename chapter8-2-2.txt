8.2.2 Using lsof
There are two basic approaches to running lsof:
*List everything and pipe the output to a command like less, and then search for what you're looking for.
This can take a while due to the amount of output generated.
*Narrow down the list that lsof provides with command-line options.

You can use command-line options to provide a filename as an argument and have lsof list only the entries that match the argumnet.
For example, the following command displays entries for open files in /usr:
$lsof /usr

To list the open files fo a particular process ID, run:
$lsof -p pid

For a brief summary of lso's many options, run lsof -h.
Most options pertain to the output format.
(See Chapter 10 for a discussion of the lsof network features.)

Note:
lsof is highly dependent on kernel information.
If you upgrade your kernel and you're not routinely updating everything, you might need to upgrade lsof.
In addition, if you perform a distribution update to both the kernel and lsof, the update lsof might not work until you rebot with the new kernel.
