When running ifconfig, you'll notice the lo interface:

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 6503  bytes 582951 (582.9 KB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 6503  bytes 582951 (582.9 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

The lo interface is virtual network interface called the loopback because it "loops back" to itself.
The effect is that connecting to 127.0.0.1 is connecting to the machine that you're currently using.
When outgoing data to localhost reaches the kernel network interface for lo, the kernel just repackages it as incoming data and sends it back through lo.

The lo loopback interface is often the only place you'll see static network configuration in boot-time scripts.
For example, Ubuntu's ifup command reads. /etc/network/interfaces and Fedora uses /etc/sysconfig/network-interfaces/ifcfg-lo.
You can often find the loopback device configuration by digging around in /etc with grep.
