9.4 Routes and the Kernel Routing Table

Connecting Internet subnets is mostly a process of identifuing the hosts connected to more than one subnet.
Returning to Figure 9-2, think about Host A at IP address 10.23.2.4.
This host is connected to a local network of 10.23.2.0/24 and can directly reach hosts on network.
To reach hosts on the rest of the Internet, it must communicate through the router at 10.23.2.1.
How does the Linux kernel distinguish between these two different kinds of destinations?
It uses a destination configuration called a routing table to determine its routing behavior.
To Show the routing table, use the route -n command.
Here's what you might see for a simple host such as 10.23.2.4:

$route -n

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 enp3s0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 enp3s0
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     100    0        0 enp3s0

The last two lines here contain the routing information.
The Destination column tells you a network prefix, and the Genmask column is the netmask corresponding to that network.
There are two networks defined in this output: 0.0.0.0/0 (which matches every address on the Internet) and 10.23.2.0/24.
Each network has a U under its Flags column, indicating that the route is active ("up").

Where the destinations differ is in the combination of their Gateway and Flags columns.
For 0.0.0.0/0, there is a G in the Flags column, meaning that communication for this netwrok must be sent through the gateway in the Gateway column (10.23.2.1, in this case).
However, for 10.23.2.0/24, there is no G in flags, indicating that the network is directly connected in some way.
Here, 0.0.0.0 is used as a stand-in under Gateway.
Ignore the other columns of output for now.

There's one tricky detail: Say the host wants to send something to 10.23.2.132, which matches both rules in the routing table, 0.0.0.0/0 and 10.23.2.0/24.
How does the kernel know to use the second one?
It chooses the longest destination prefix that matches.
This is there CIDR network form comes in particularly handy: 10.23.2.0/24 matches, and its prefix is 24 bits long; 0.0.0.0/0 also matches, but its prefix is 0 bits long (that is, it has no prefix), so the rule for 10.23.2.0/24 takes priority.

Note: The -n option route to show IP addresses instead of showing hots and networks by name.
This is an important option to rememeber because you'll be able to use it in other network-related commands such as netstat.

9.4.1 The Default Gateway
An entry for 0.0.0.0/0 in the routing table has special significance because it matches any address on the Internet.
This is the default route, and the address configured under the Gateway column (in the route -n output) in the default route is the default gateway.
When no other rules match, the default route always does, and the default gateway is where you send messages when there is no other choice.
You can configure a host without a default gateway, but it won't be able to reach hosts outside the destinations in the routing table.

Note:
On most networks with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, the router is usually at address  1 of the subnet (for example, 10.23.2.1 in 10.23.2.0/24).
Because this is simply a convention, there can be exceptions.
