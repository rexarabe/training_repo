9.7 Understading Kernel Network Interface

The physical and the Internet layers must be connected in a way that allows the Internet layer to retain its hardware-independent flexibility.
The Linux kernel maintains its own division between the two layers and provides communication standards for liking them called a (kernel) network interface.
When you configure a network interface, you link the IP address settings from the Internet side with the hardware indentification on the physical device side.
Network interface have names that usually indicate the kind of hardware underneath, such as eth0 (the first Ethernet card in the computer) and wlan0 (a wireless interface).
In Section 9.3.1, you learned the most important command for viewing or manually configuring the network interface settings: ifconfig.
Recall this output:

see the page 200

For each network interface, the left side of the output shows the interface name, and the right side contains settings and statistics for the interface.
In addition to the Internet layer pieces that we've already covered, you also see the MAC address on the physical layer (HWaddr).
The lines containing UP and RUNNING tell you that the interface is working.
Although ifconfig shows some hardware informtion (in this case, even some low-level device settings such as the interrupt and memory used), it's designed primarily for viewing and configuring the software layer attached to the interfaces.
To dig deeper into the hardware and physical layer behind a network interface, use something like the ethtool command to display or change the settings on Ethernet cards.
(We'll look briefly at wireless networks in Section 9.23)
