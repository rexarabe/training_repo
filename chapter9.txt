Chapter 9:
Understanding your network and its configuration

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and sending data between them.
Thats sounds simple enough, but to understand how it works, you need to ask two fundamental questions:
* How does the computer sending the data know where to send its data? know where to send its data?
* When the destination computer receives the data, how does it know what it just received?

A computer answers these questions by using a series of components, with each one responsible for a certain aspect of sending, receivingm, and indentifying data.
The components are arranged in groups that form network layers, which stack on top of each other in order to form a complete system.
The Linux kernel handles networking in a similar way to the SCSI subsystem described in Chapter 3.

Because each layer tends to be independent, it's possible to build networks with many different combinations of components.
This is where network configuration can become very complicated.
For this reason, we'll begin this chapter by looking at the layers in very simple networks.
You'll learn how to view your own network settings, and when you understand the basic workings of each layer, you'll be ready to learn how to configure those layers by yourself.
Finally, you'll move on to more advanced topics like building your own networks and configuring firewalls.
(Skip over that material if your eyes start to glaze over, you can always come back.)
