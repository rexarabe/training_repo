When mounting a filesystem, the common terminology is "mount a device on a mount point."
TO learn the current filesystem status of your system, run mount. The output should look like this:

See project8.txt for more details

Each Line corresponds to one currenlty mounted filesystem, with items in this order:
*the device, such as /dev/sda3. Notice that some of these aren't real deives (proc, for example) but are stand-ins for real device names because these special-purpose filesystems do not need devices.
*The word on.
*The mount point.
*The word type.
*The filesystem type, usually in the form of a short identifier.
* Mount options (in parentheses). (See Section 4.2.6 for more details.)

To mount a filesystem, use the mount command as follows with the file system type, device, and desire mount point:

#mount -t type device mountpoint

For Example, to mount the Fourth Extended filesystem /dev/sdf2 on /home/extra, use this command:

#umount mountpoint

You can also unmount a filesytem with its device instead of its mount point.
